Mobile Ad-Hoc networks are not new to computer science, but the concept of a a well organized free open-sourced routing simulator that can demonstrate routing protocols used in Ad-Hoc networks is still not a reality. DARS will serve as a learning tool for students and other members of the open source community to explore and experiment with Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks.  This simulator will be capable of demonstrating two different routing protocols initially, but will also have the room to expand its capabilities.  The simulator will be able to play out many real life scenarios, allowing users to seek out a routing protocol that can optimize the Mobile Ad-Hoc Network experience.  After completion the project it will be turned over to the open source community for further expansion and maintenance.
